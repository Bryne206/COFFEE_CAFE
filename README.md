Coffee Café — Early Preview

This is a simple first look at my Coffee Café website. 
It’s still in active development, and many improvements, features, and style updates will be added as the project grows. 
Think of this version as the starter aroma before the full brew.

Status

Work in Progress
More pages, animations, responsive layouts, and refined UI are coming soon. This is only the foundation.

Project Structure
/coffee-cafe
│── index.html
│── coffee.css
│── coffee.js
│── /images
│     └── (backgrounds, logos, café photos)

*index.html
-Holds the main structure of the page.
This is where the sections, text, images, and layout skeleton live.

*coffee.css(found in the html file)
-Controls the look and feel — colors, layout, fonts, spacing, responsiveness.

*coffee.js
-Handles interactivity. Anything that moves, animates, toggles, or responds lives here.
-images folder

*All pictures used on the site, including:
-background images
-logos
-menu item images
-Make sure to update the image paths in the HTML and CSS if you move files around.

How to Run the Project

-No frameworks. No servers. Nothing complicated.
-Download or clone the repository
-git clone <The repo link>
-Open the project folder.
-Locate index.html.
-Double-click it.
-Your browser will open the website instantly.
-If you’re editing code, any modern code editor (VS Code, Sublime, Atom) works perfectly.

How to Modify the Files
*Editing the HTML

-Open index.html.
-Change texts, add sections, or adjust the layout.
-If you add new images, place them in the images folder and update their paths.

*Editing the CSS
-Check the coffee.css file
-Here you can:

change colors
modify spacing
update fonts
adjust layout for mobile
tweak the overall design
It’s the wardrobe of the site.

*Editing the JavaScript

Open coffee.js.
-Use this file to add interactions like:

-menu toggles
-animations
-future features (login, cart, rating, etc.)

*Future Updates (Planned)
These will roll out as the project matures:

-complete café menu page
-improved UI/UX
-mobile-friendly responsive design
-ordering/cart system
-customer reviews section
-admin/owner dashboard (maybe)
-better animations and transitions

Final Note

This project is evolving. It’s not perfect yet — far from it — but it’s growing steadily. 
More updates will come as I refine the design, add new features, and polish the experience.
